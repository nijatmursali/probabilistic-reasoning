What is the expected monetary value of a lottery ticket? When (if ever) is it rational to buy a ticket? Be precise - show an equation involving utilities. You may assume current wealth of $\\$k$ and that $U(S_k) = 0$. You may also assume that $U(S_{k+10}) = 10 \\times U(S_{k+1})$, but you may not make any assumptions about $U(S_{k+1,000,000})$. Sociological studies show that people with lower income buy a disproportionate number of lottery tickets. Do you think this is because they are worse decision makers or because they have a different utility function? Consider the value of contemplating the possibility of winning the lottery versus the value of contemplating becoming an action hero while watching an adventure movie.\n"
