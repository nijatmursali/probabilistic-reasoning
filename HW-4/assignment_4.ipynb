    "Let's suppose that we have a very simple line following robot. The robot is a differential drive, so it has two motors. The commands sent to the motors depend on the measurements of two light sensors; the sensors measure whether the robot is within or outside a line and are positioned on the left and right side of the robot. Segments of the line that our robot needs to follow are near a wall, so incorrect motor commands may lead to collisions with the wall.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before moving to the question itself let's explain what are casual and diagnostic inferences. Casual inference happens when some event is the cause of another event (we can denote is as P(A|B) where A is the cause of B). For diagnostic inference, as understandable from it's name, we use effect (symptom) to inference a cause (We can denote is as P(B|A)). For this case we have to use Baye's Rule. Regarding to answer to question itself, this is casual model because we want to find a cause as we have an evidence.  "
